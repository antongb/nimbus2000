# AudioNimbus



## Minimum Viable Product
AudioNimbus is a music app inspired by SoundCloud, built on Rails and Backbone.
Users can:

- [x] Create accounts
- [x] Create sessions (log in)
- [x] Play tracks
- [x] Upload tracks
- [x] Tag tracks
- [x] View tracks
- [x] Follow users
- [x] View a feed of tracks from followed users
- [x] Search for tracks by title
- [x] Search for tracks by tag

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Uploading/Showing/Playing Tracks (~2.5 day)
I will implement user authentication in Rails based on the practices learned at
App Academy. By the end of this phase users will be able to upload, view and
play tracks.


### Phase 2: JSON API and First Backbone Views (~2.5 days)
I will add API routes to serve user and track data as JSON, then add Backbone
models and collections that fetch data from those routes. By the end of this
phase, the existing Rails views will have been ported over to Backbone.


### Phase 3: Following and Tagging Tracks (~1 days)
I will implement the ability for users to follow other users and tag tracks.
A User's feed/stream will show tracks uploaded by user's that they follow. Tags
will appear under a track on the track's show view.


### Phase 4: Searching for Tracks (~1 days)
I will implement the ability to search for tracks by either their track name or
by tag names. At this stage I will start putting finishing touches on my page
layout.


### Bonus Features (TBD)
- [x] Trending feed (from follows)
- [x] Track comments
- [x] User Profile
